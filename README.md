# Handwritten-Digits-Recognization
Machine Learning algo that has been trained by TensorFlow dataset and can identify handwritten digits 0-9.
Upload a 28x28 pixel image of your or any handwritten number as 'image.png' to the same file as neuralNetworks.py.
The programme will use the machine learning model to predict the digit written with over 90% accuracy.
